# Lab 2: Geotagged Tweets

This lab looks at geotagged tweets from two different time periods in the United States. The first was taken on April 20th at 11:49pm PST, and the second was captured midday on April 21st. I chose these two periods in order to see how tweets change in content during the day compared to later at night.
